      <p class="story_text">
        Hi, I'm Julia! I built this website with the quotes above in the first place because they are my personal mantra. They are
        words I have lived by, including in my current career as a Web Developer and my former career as a Concert Pianist,
        Arranger, Composer, and Accompanist.
      </p>

      <h1 class="about_me section_one">My Motivation: </h1>

      <p class="story_text">
        My love of learning new things and being challenged comes from my childhood: When I was 10 years old, I was using my mom's
        386 desktop when it suddenly broke. Windows 3.1 wouldn't boot from dos. So I decided (somewhat foolishly) to take
        a screwdriver and unscrew the entire computer apart.

      </p>
      <p class="story_text bottom_story_text">
        At this time, there was no instructional manual, no technical support to call, and no internet (America Online was in it's
        infancy). And so I sat there for hours on the floor of my bedroom with all the parts spread around me. And slowly
        I figured out how to put it together. And when I turned the machine on, to my (and my parents') surprise, it worked!

      <h2>BoardgameGeek Api </h2>
      <p class="story_text">
        I'm a huge nerd, so naturally boardgames are one of my most enjoyable hobbies! Over time, I've frequently purchased games on kickstarter or at the local game store that I have found through the BoardgameGeek website. I set out to make a usable ui that would list the many various statistics for board games without overwhelming the user. 
      </p>
      <p class="story_text">
        I also wanted to include video walkthroughs of the games with an embedded Youtube iframe for those that are interested in how a particular game plays. Also included was the "hot list" which rendered a list of the hottest upcoming or just released board games.
        </p>

        <p class="story_text bottom_story_text"> 
        As the sole developer on this project, I was responsible for developing the mvp as well as the polished version. That included the app architecture, styling, ajax calls, and code structure. After developing the mvp, I submitted the project for peer review and made changes to features as well as bug fixes.
        </p>

        <h3>Major challenges included: </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple concurrent AJAX requests</li>
          <li>Conversion of XML to JSON format</li>
          <li>Using a proxy to circumvent a CORS header error</li>
          <li>Limiting API calls and Caching data to work around specific API limitations</li>
          <li>Data correction on the front end</li>
          <li>SEO and responsive</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technologies used:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML5</li>
          <li>CSS3</li>
          <li>Javascript</li>
