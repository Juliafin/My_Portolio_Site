      <h1 class="about_me section_one" id="About_Me">About Me</h1>

      <p class="story_text">
        Hi, I'm Julia! Thank you for visiting my page! I'm a Web Developer passionate about writing clean, efficient, and readable
        code. I get excited about being faced with new challenges and learning how to overcome them. I'm also a classically
        trained concert pianist,composer, arranger, teacher, accompanist. Also, I'm a huge nerd with interests: technology,
        audio engineering, graphic design, photography, science, history, cooking, politics, video games, board games, and
        computers. I'm equally comfortable wearing many hats (just not literally, I look terrible in some hats).
      </p>
      <p class="story_text">
        I find it intellectually stimulating, challenging, and most importantly fun! It doesn't feel like work to me. For me, that
        is what the title quotes represent.
      </p>

      <h1 class="about_me section_one">My Motivation</h1>

      <p class="story_text">
        I've alsways been that person who's friends always turn to for computer help or technical support. My love of learning new
        things and being challenged comes from my childhood: When I was 10 years old, I was using my mom's 386 desktop when
        it suddenly broke. Windows 3.1 wouldn't boot from dos. So I decided (somewhat foolishly) to take a screwdriver and
        unscrew the entire computer apart.

      </p>
      <p class="story_text bottom_story_text">
        At this time, there was no instructional manual, no technical support to call, and no internet (America Online was in it's
        infancy). And so I sat there for hours on the floor of my bedroom with all the parts spread around me. And slowly
        I figured out how to put it together. And when I turned the machine on, to my (and my parents') surprise, it worked!

      <h2>BoardgameGeek Api </h2>
      <p class="story_text">
        I'm a huge nerd, so naturally boardgames are one of my most enjoyable hobbies! Over time, I've frequently purchased games
        on kickstarter or at the local game store that I have found through the BoardgameGeek website. I set out to make
        a usable ui that would list the many various statistics for board games without overwhelming the user.
      </p>
      <p class="story_text">
        I also wanted to include video walkthroughs of the games with an embedded Youtube iframe for those that are interested in
        how a particular game plays. Also included was the "hot list" which rendered a list of the hottest upcoming or just
        released board games.
      </p>

      <p class="story_text bottom_story_text">
        As the sole developer on this project, I was responsible for developing the mvp as well as the polished version. That included
        the app architecture, styling, ajax calls, and code structure. After developing the mvp, I submitted the project
        for peer review and made changes to features as well as bug fixes.
      </p>

      <h3>Major challenges included: </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple concurrent AJAX requests</li>
        <li>Conversion of XML to JSON format</li>
        <li>Using a proxy to circumvent a CORS header error</li>
        <li>Limiting API calls and Caching data to work around specific API limitations</li>
        <li>Data correction on the front end</li>
        <li>SEO and responsive</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technologies used:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML5</li>
        <li>CSS3</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>AJAX</li>
        <li>JQuery</li>
        <li>Youtube Api</li>
