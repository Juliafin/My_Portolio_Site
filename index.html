        <p class="story_text">
          Hi, I'm Julia! I built this website with the quotes above in the first place because they are my personal mantra. They are
          words I have lived by, including in my current career as a Web Developer and my former career as a Concert Pianist,
          Arranger, Composer, and Accompanist.
        </p>

        <h1 class="about_me">My motivation: </h1>

        <p class="story_text">
          My love of learning new things and being challenged comes from my childhood: When I was 10 years old, I was using my mom's
          386 desktop when it suddenly broke. Windows 3.1 wouldn't boot from dos. So I decided (somewhat foolishly) to take
          a screwdriver and unscrew the entire computer apart. At this time, there was no instructional manual, no technical
          support to call, and no internet (America Online was in it's infancy). And so I sat there for hours on the floor
          of my bedroom with all the parts spread around me. And slowly I figured out how to put it together. And when I
          turned the machine on, to my (and my parents') surprise, it worked!
