      <h2>BoardgameGeek Api </h2>

        I'm a huge nerd, so naturally boardgames are one of my most enjoyable hobbies! Over time, I've frequently purchased games
        on kickstarter or at the local game store that I have found through the <i>BoardgameGeek</i> website. As
        my first Capstone, I set out to make a usable ui that would list the many various statistics for board games without
        overwhelming the user.
      </p>

      <p class="story_text bottom_story_text">
        Being the sole developer on this project, I was responsible for developing the mvp (minimum viable product) in both concept
        and execution, as well as the polished version. This included the app architecture, styling, ajax calls, and code
        structure. After developing the mvp, I submitted the project for peer review and made changes to features as well
        as bug fixes.
      </p>

      <h3>Major challenges</h3>

      <p class="story_text">
        The first major challenge was circumventing a CORS error due to BoardgameGeek Api not having their CORS headers enabled.
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="hljs javascript">
         (function() {
    var cors_api_host = // proxy for CORS here: 'corsproxy.' ;
    var cors_api_url = 'http://' + cors_api_host + '/';
    var slice = [].slice;
    var origin = window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.host;
    var open = XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open;
    XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open = function() {
        var args = slice.call(arguments);
        var targetOrigin = /^https?:\/\/([^\/]+)/i.exec(args[1]);
        if (targetOrigin && targetOrigin[0].toLowerCase() !== origin &&
            targetOrigin[1] !== cors_api_host) {
            args[1] = cors_api_url + args[1];
        }
        return open.apply(this, args);
    };
})(); 
        </code>
      </pre>


      <p class="story_text">
        The main difficulty in working with this API was that it was XML. The data needed to be converted to JSON so that it could
        be parsed and processed appropriately.
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="hljs javascript">
          function xmlToJson(xml) {
	var obj = {};

	if (xml.nodeType == 1) {
		if (xml.attributes.length > 0) {
		obj["@attributes"] = {};
			for (var j = 0; j < xml.attributes.length; j++) {
				var attribute = xml.attributes.item(j);
				obj["@attributes"][attribute.nodeName] = attribute.nodeValue;
			}
		}
	} else if (xml.nodeType == 3) { // text
		obj = xml.nodeValue;
	}

	// do children
	if (xml.hasChildNodes()) {
		for(var i = 0; i < xml.childNodes.length; i++) {
			var item = xml.childNodes.item(i);
			var nodeName = item.nodeName;
			if (typeof(obj[nodeName]) == "undefined") {
				obj[nodeName] = xmlToJson(item);
			} else {
				if (typeof(obj[nodeName].push) == "undefined") {
					var old = obj[nodeName];
					obj[nodeName] = [];
					obj[nodeName].push(old);
				}
				obj[nodeName].push(xmlToJson(item));
			}
		}
	}
	return obj;
};
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p class="story_text">
        The resulting conversion caused issues with inconsistent JSON values. The solution was apply manual data correction before
        rendering the output to the DOM.
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="hljs javascript">
            // If the key 'boardgamemechanics' exists in the JSON (as an object),
  // Apply one set of conversions.
  // If not, treat the key as an array.
  if ('boardgamemechanics' in BggData.singleSearch) {
    if (Array.isArray(BggData.singleSearch.boardgamemechanics)) {
      var boardgamemechanicshtml = BggData.singleSearch.boardgamemechanics.map(function(element) {
        return `<li>${element}</li>`;
      }).join().replace(/,/g, '');

    } else if (!('boardgamemechanics' in BggData.singleSearch)) {
      return;

    } else {
      var boardgamemechanicshtml = BggData.singleSearch.boardgamemechanics;

    }
  } else {
    // convert board game mechanics to a list
    if (Array.isArray(BggData.mainData[index].boardgamemechanics)) {
      var boardgamemechanicshtml = BggData.mainData[index].boardgamemechanics.map(function(element) {
        return `<li>${element}</li>`;
      }).join().replace(/,/g, '');

    } else if (!('boardgamemechanics' in BggData.mainData[index])) {
      return;

    } else {
      var boardgamemechanicshtml = BggData.mainData[index].boardgamemechanics;
    }

  }

      <h2>Final Fantasy Quiz</h2>
      <p class="story_text">
        Growing up, I was a huge fan of rpgs, and in particular the creations of then Squaresoft (now SquareEnix). Particularly I
        loved the stories with incredibly well developed characters, mature themes, and strategic gameplay. If your opinion
        is that Final Fantasy VII is the best Final Fantasy, I will argue with you (it was good but the depth of Final Fantasy
        VI was unmatched)!
      </p>

      <p class="story_text">
        With this project, my goal was to recreate the look and feel of the classic final fantasy menu <img class="ff-quiz_screenshot_2"
          alt="Final Fantasy quiz screenshot 2"> and test user's knowledge about classic games in the series. I wanted this
        project to be a memorable experience, and with that in mind I wanted the user to be able to select a character.
        <img
          class="ff-quiz_screenshot_2" alt="Final Fantasy quiz screeenshot 2">
      </p>
      <p class="story_text">
        The beginning of the project involved writing out the user experience, and some notes about the inner logic of the application.
        The goal was to mock up the html of the landing page and main quiz page and wireframe basic styling. As my work on
        the project progressed, I worked on editing character sprites in Adobe Photoshop and sound effects in Adobe Audition.
      </p>
      <p class="story_text">
        There were many challenges in this project including asynchronous javascript, custom radio button logic, appropriate use
        of event listeners, and implementation of styling and the interface.

      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="javascript hljs">
          function testSelectedAnswer() {
  //

    var selectedAnswer = $("[class*='green-selected']").text().replace(/^.../, "");
    var rightAnswer = quizState.questionsAndAnswers[quizState.currentQuestion-1].correctAnswer;

        if (selectedAnswer === rightAnswer) answerIsCorrect();
        else if (selectedAnswer !== rightAnswer) answerIsWrong();

        var selectionClasses = quizState.answerClasses;
        var answerArray = quizState.questionsAndAnswers[quizState.currentQuestion-1].answers;
        answerArray.forEach(function(element, index){
          if (element === rightAnswer) {
            $(selectionClasses[index]).addClass('green-selected');
          } else {
            $(selectionClasses[index]).addClass('red-selected');

          };

        });

      <p class="story_text">
        Hi, I'm Julia! Thank you for visiting my page! I'm a Web Developer passionate about writing clean, efficient, and readable
        code. I get excited about being faced with new challenges and learning how to overcome them. I'm also a classically
        trained concert pianist,composer, arranger, teacher, accompanist. Also, I'm a huge nerd with interests: technology,
        audio engineering, graphic design, photography, science, history, cooking, politics, video games, board games, and
        computers. I'm equally comfortable wearing many hats (just not literally, I look terrible in some hats).
      </p>
      <p class="story_text">
        The quotes above are a way of life for me. I've always held to the belief that one of the most important things is to find
        something that you are good at, and that you find intellectually stimulating. What I enjoy most about coding is finding
        innovative solutions to problems. And no matter how long I spend at a problem, It never feels as though it is work.
      </p>

      <h1 class="about_me section_one">My Motivation</h1>

      <p class="story_text">
        I've always been that person who's friends always turn to for computer help or technical support. My love of learning new
        things and being challenged comes from my childhood: When I was 10 years old, I was using my mom's 386 desktop when
        it suddenly broke. Windows 3.1 wouldn't boot from dos. So I decided (somewhat foolishly) to take a screwdriver and
        unscrew the entire computer apart.

      </p>
      <p class="story_text bottom_story_text">
        At this time, there was no instruction manual, no technical support to call, and no internet (America Online was in it's
        infancy). And so I sat there for hours on the floor of my bedroom with all the computer parts spread around me. After
        several hours, I figured out what each part did, and how to put it together. And when I turned the machine on, to
        my (and my parents') surprise, it worked! For me, that moment when you run code and it works for the first time is
        incredibly satisfying and rewarding!
