        I'm a huge nerd, so naturally boardgames are one of my most enjoyable hobbies! Over time, I've frequently purchased games on kickstarter or at the local game store that I have found through the <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com" target="_blank"><i>BoardgameGeek</i></a> website. As my first Capstone, I set out to make a usable UI that would list the many various statistics for board games without overwhelming the user. A fun bonus: I photographed and edited the title and 404 images with my trusty Nikon D90 (I'm a semi-professional photographer as well).
      </p>
      <p class="story_text bottom_story_text">
        Being the sole developer on this project, I was responsible for developing the MVP (minimum viable product) in both concept and execution, as well as the polished version. This included the app architecture, styling, AJAX calls, and code structure. After developing the MVP, I submitted the project for peer review and made changes to features as well as bug fixes.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>

        <p class="story_text">
          The first major challenge was circumventing a CORS error due to BoardgameGeek Api not having CORS headers enabled.
        </p>

        <pre>
        <code class="hljs javascript">
  (function() {
    
    var cors_api_host = // proxy for CORS here: 'corsproxy.' ;
    var cors_api_url = 'http://' + cors_api_host + '/';
    var slice = [].slice;
    var origin = window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.host;
    var open = XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open;
    XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open = function() {
        var args = slice.call(arguments);
        var targetOrigin = /^https?:\/\/([^\/]+)/i.exec(args[1]);
        if (targetOrigin && targetOrigin[0].toLowerCase() !== origin &&
            targetOrigin[1] !== cors_api_host) {
            args[1] = cors_api_url + args[1];
        }
        return open.apply(this, args);
    };
})();

      </pre>


        <p class="story_text">
          The BoardgameGeek Api being in XML format created significant challenges. As a result, the data needed to be converted to JSON so that it could be parsed and processed appropriately.
        </p>

        for (var j = 0; j < xml.attributes.length; j++) {
          var attribute = xml.attributes.item(j);
          obj["@attributes"][attribute.nodeName] = attribute.nodeValue;
        }
      }
    } else if (xml.nodeType == 3) { // text
      obj = xml.nodeValue;
    }

    
    if (xml.hasChildNodes()) {
      for(var i = 0; i < xml.childNodes.length; i++) {
        var item = xml.childNodes.item(i);

        <p class="story_text">
          The resulting conversion caused issues with inconsistent JSON values. The solution was apply manual data correction before rendering the output to the DOM.

          In terms of site layout, in order to display the detailed information for each board game result, the JSON data was first cached to avoid multiple API calls due to API limitations.

      <h2>Final Fantasy Quiz</h2>
      <p class="story_text">
        Growing up, I was a huge fan of role playing games (RPGS), and in particular the creations of then Squaresoft (now SquareEnix). Particularly I loved the stories with incredibly well developed characters, mature themes, and strategic gameplay. If your opinion is that Final Fantasy VII is the best Final Fantasy, I will argue with you (it was good but the depth of Final Fantasy VI was unmatched)!

        <h3>Challenges</h3>

        <p class="story_text">
          With this project, my goal was to recreate the look and feel of the classic final fantasy menu and test user's knowledge about classic games in the series. I wanted this project to be a memorable experience, and with that in mind I wanted the user to be able to select a character.

        </p>
        <p class="story_text">
          The beginning of the project involved writing out the user experience, and some notes about the inner logic of the application. The goal was to mock up the HTML of the landing page and main quiz page and wireframe basic styling. As my work on the project progressed, I worked on editing character sprites in Adobe Photoshop and sound effects in Adobe Audition.
        </p>
        <p class="story_text">
          Some of the challenges this project included were asynchronous javascript (implemented using the JQuery library), custom radio button logic, appropriate use of event listeners, and implementation of styling and the interface. Application behavior was managed with a virtual state layer.

      <h2>Visual Studio Code - Tropical theme </h2>

      <p class="story_text">
        As the kind of person who is always interested in improving my workflow, I'm always refining my development environment, tweaking the editor I use, and learning new shortcuts. After using different IDE/text editors including IntelliJ, Notepad++, Sublime Text 3, and Atom, I settled on my new favorite editor, Visual Studio Code.
      </p>

      <p class="story_text">
        After spending a significant amount of time configuring the editor, I could not settle on a theme, so I decided to publish my own (available from the VS Code extension marketplace under the name "tropical"). Given the amount of time I spend coding, using a theme I enjoyed was not just aesthetically important; it improved my workflow by allowing me to parse code easier and faster. The tropical theme is focused on high contrast and varied colors for optimal visibility.

        The text analyzer web app was my first foray into javascript. With every project I've worked on, I've pushed myself to learn new tools and libraries to be a better developer.

      <h1 class="about_me section_one" id="About_Me">About Me</h1>

      <p class="story_text">
        Hi, I'm Julia! Thank you for visiting my page! I'm a Web Developer passionate about writing clean, efficient, and readable code. I get excited about being faced with new challenges and learning how to overcome them. I'm also a classically trained concert pianist, composer, arranger, teacher, accompanist. Also, I'm a huge nerd with interests: technology, audio engineering, graphic design, photography, science, history, cooking, politics, video games, board games, and computers. I'm equally comfortable wearing many hats (just not literally, I look terrible in some hats).
      </p>
      <p class="story_text">
        The quotes above are a way of life for me. I've always held to the belief that one of the most important things is to find something that you are good at, and that you find intellectually stimulating. What I enjoy most about coding is finding innovative solutions to problems. And no matter how long I spend at a problem, It never feels as though it is work.
      </p>

      <h1 class="about_me section_one">My Motivation</h1>

      <p class="story_text">
        I've always been that person whose friends always turn to for computer help or technical support. My love of learning new things and being challenged comes from my childhood: When I was 10 years old, I was using my mom's 386 desktop when it suddenly broke. Windows 3.1 wouldn't boot from DOS. So I decided (somewhat foolishly) to take a screwdriver and unscrew the entire computer apart.

      </p>
      <p class="story_text bottom_story_text">
        At this time, there was no instruction manual, no technical support to call, and no internet (America Online was in it's infancy). And so I sat there for hours on the floor of my bedroom with all the computer parts spread around me. After several hours, I figured out what each part did, and how to put it together. And when I turned the machine on, to my (and my parents') surprise, it worked! For me, that moment when you run code and it works for the first time is incredibly satisfying and rewarding!
      </p>

      <h1 class="about_me section_one">My Goals</h1>

      <p class="story_text">
        I see myself in the future as an experienced developer, with a specialization in data science. I'm interested in combining my expertise in music to eventually write some useful software particularly in the category of music production and music notation. I eventually want to also learn how to develop for mobile platforms such as Android and IOS. Overall, I will pursue anything that intrigues me intellectually and provides a challenge!
